# Eastgate CTW Hub

## Why does this exist? What is it?

See the [front page of the wiki](https://github.com/margeobur/eastgate-cwt/wiki/Home)

## Instructions for end users

Almost anyone reading this probably isn't interested, but there's a bit of documentation [here](https://github.com/margeobur/eastgate-cwt/wiki/Instructions-for-use) on how to use it (as an end user) (there really isn't much to it though)

## Building and running

- Install node.js
- Clone the repo
- run build.bat
- run clean.bat (optional)
- run run.bat

~~After installing node, open up a command prompt. 
- cd into ./frontend ~~
~~- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`~~
~~- cd into ./backend (../backend from the frontend folder)
- run `npm install`~~
~~- run `npm run build`
- run `node ./dist/server/index.js`~~
~~- navigate to localhost:50000 to test that the web server is working ~~
